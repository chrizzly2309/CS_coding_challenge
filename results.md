# What is the most dangerous are/borough for cyclists ?
Brooklyn has the highest number of accidents, injuries and fatalities. It is also the highest of these figures per capita, thus Brooklyn is the most dangerous borough.

# How can location of bike stations be changed to increase safety?
Accidents with injury or fatality occur much more often on intersections than on street. Bike stations are mostly all on intersections. 
Thus, it might be an option to move bie stations from intersection to a street. However, this is probably missleading. Cyclist do not have accidents at or close to intersections because there is a bike station, but more likely because they interact with other traffic participants at those places. 

# Predictive model: Do bike stations cause and predict accidents nearby?
The distance to stations is not a good predictor for accidents. Half of the predicted accidents is less than ~150m away from the closest station.
